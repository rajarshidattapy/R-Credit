# R-Credit - Buidl on CTC Ideathon, India

R-Credit solves the fundamental problem of credit in decentralized systems: users can create unlimited wallets to escape bad credit history. It creates a non-escapable, privacy-preserving credit identity using zero-knowledge proofs.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI**: TailwindCSS + Shadcn/ui components + Framer Motion
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **State**: TanStack Query
- **Blockchain**: Solidity smart contracts (EVM-compatible)
- **ZK Proofs**: Noir language (identity verification)

### Key Layers

1. **Identity Layer** - Zero-knowledge proof verification via PAN + device binding
2. **Credit Enforcement** - Protected deposit wallets & credit score tracking
3. **RWA Integration** - Tokenization of real-world assets tied to verified identities
4. **Blockchain** - CreditCoin ledger for global credit history

---

## 📁 Project Structure

### Main Application (`src/`)

- **Pages**: 8 core pages including Landing, Dashboard, BorrowLend, Vault, CreditProfile, IdentityVerification, RWATokenization
- **Components**: Full Shadcn/ui library (40+ components) + custom layout components
- **Routing**: Clean SPA routing with catch-all 404 handling


### Smart Contracts (`contracts/`)

- `agricultural.sol` - Agricultural commodity tokenization
- `real_estate.sol` - Fractional real estate tokens
- `carbon.sol` - Carbon credit NFTs
- `art.sol` - Art & collectibles

All contracts bind tokens to issuer identity hashes for accountability.

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs (`zkproof/`)

- `identity.nr` - Noir circuit for identity verification
- Merkle tree depth: 20 levels
- Proves identity without revealing PAN or device info

---

## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. Non-Escapable Identity

- One identity per human using PAN card + device fingerprint
- ZK proof commits identity to Merkle tree on-chain
- Privacy-preserving: no personal data stored

### 2. Multi-Wallet Support

- Users can use unlimited wallet addresses
- All credit activity resolves to single identity
- Cannot reset credit by creating new wallets

### 3. Protected Deposit Wallet

- Borrowed funds go to protocol-controlled wallet
- Prevents "borrow and run" scenarios
- Forces repayment before full access

### 4. RWA Tokenization

- Real estate, agricultural commodities, carbon credits, art
- Issuers bound to verified identities
- Default on any asset impacts credit across all assets

### 5. Credit Scoring System

- On-chain, transparent credit scores
- Based on repayment history
- Better rates for better behavior
- Defaults are permanent and visible

## 🚀 User Flows

1. **Identity Verification** → PAN entry → Device binding → ZK proof generation
2. **Borrowing** → Amount selection → Loan confirmation → Deposit wallet funded
3. **Lending** → Pool selection → Deposit funds → Earn APR
4. **RWA Tokenization** → Asset details → Deploy contract → Tokens created

---

## 📊 Business Model

### Target Users

- **Lenders**: Lower default risk, better pricing
- **Borrowers**: Access to undercollateralized loans
- **RWA Issuers**: Make assets credit-ready
- **DeFi Protocols**: Expand addressable market

### Value Proposition

- Reduce collateral requirements from 150% to 20-50%
- Enable credit for emerging markets
- Create portable, global credit history
- Integrate real-world assets into DeFi

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

- **Dev Server**: Port 8080, IPv6 enabled
- **Build Tool**: Vite with SWC for fast compilation
- **Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library
- **Linting**: ESLint 9 with TypeScript support
- **Package Manager**: Supports both npm and bun (lockfile present)

---

## 🔍 Notable Technical Decisions

- Separate landing page with different build system (legacy CRA)
- Comprehensive component library (40+ Shadcn components)
- Mock backend - No real blockchain integration yet (simulated delays)
- ZK proof circuit written but not integrated into frontend
- Multiple RWA contract types for different asset classes

---

## 🎯 Development Status

This appears to be a **hackathon/demo project** for CreditCoin:

### ✅ Completed

- Frontend fully functional with mock data
- Smart contracts written but not deployed
- ZK circuits drafted but not fully integrated
- No actual wallet connection or blockchain interaction
- Beautiful UI with complete user flows

### ❌ Missing Production Elements

- Wallet integration (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- Actual blockchain deployment
- ZK proof generation/verification
- Real PAN verification API
- Backend APIs for credit scoring

---

## 📈 Potential Next Steps

1. Integrate Web3 wallet connection
2. Deploy contracts to testnet
3. Build ZK proof generation pipeline
4. Add real identity verification API
5. Implement credit scoring logic
6. Add unit/integration tests
7. Set up CI/CD pipeline
